ADMET-Based Machine Learning Model for Pancreatic Cancer Drug Discovery


Overview
This repository presents a machine learning model designed to analyze ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) properties derived from molecular docking results of biomarkers and corresponding drugs. The workflow integrates SWISSADME predictions to enhance drug screening for pancreatic cancer.Machine Learning modeling on molecular datasets to predict aqueous solubility (MLOG P), an important ADMET property.

Key Features

Data Processing: Extracts molecular docking results and ADMET properties.

Feature Engineering: Utilizes SWISSADME for additional drug-likeness evaluation.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes molecular properties and correlations.

Model Training: Implements various ML algorithms for predictive modeling.

Evaluation Metrics: Assesses model performance using accuracy, RÂ², and MSE.
